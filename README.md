Project for course 811312A: Data structures and algorithms 

Program for solving minimax path problem

Kruskal's algorithm is used first for finding the minimum spanning tree,
in which lies the minimax path. Then breadth first search algorithm and 
backtracking are used for finding the shortest path to the goal node.
